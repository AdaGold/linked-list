# Linked-List

Using object oriented design constructs, define a Node class and LinkedList class for a singly linked list. Each node has integer data value and a link to the next node. The linked list class has a head node and the following methods defined.

## Exercise

Design and implement the classes and the methods. Implement the methods within the Linked List class that are currently raising NotImplementedError.

### Going Further

Create a new class called `DoublyLinkedList` which implements a doubly linked list.  Then implement the following methods:  

- `add_first`
- `add_last`
- `get_first`
- `get_at_index(index)`
- `reverse`
- `delete(value)`
